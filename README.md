This project outlines an approach to address ransomware attack within organizational networks, focusing on future prevention, detection, mitigation, incident response, and 
collaboration with stakeholders and external parties. I used this case study to simulate how to enhance organizational security architecture, minimize disruption, and foster 
communication and collaboration during and after cyber attacks. 
Key components include identifying stakeholders, implementing cybersecurity measures, communicating effectively during and after incidents, and collaborating with law enforcement, 
cybersecurity experts, and regulatory bodies to mitigate risks and share threat intelligence.
I belived that through this strategy, organizations can bolster their cybersecurity posture and mitigate the impact of ransomware attacks.
